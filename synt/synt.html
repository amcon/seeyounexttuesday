<div class="about">
  <h1>What is it?</h1>
  <p>“SYNT is taking the do-it-all female comedy movement from the screen to the stage.
  Picking up cues from power chicks like Tina Fey and Lena Dunham, Erica Vlahinos has
  been bringing her brand of in-your-face funny feminism to New York since 2014.
  <br>
  Tired of playing dirty whores, virginal wives and chubby best friends, Vlahinos shifted
  gears from one end of the table to the other to write complex female leads, challenge
  stereotypes and most importantly, make people laugh. Proving that women can be strong,
  sexy and fucking hilarious.”</p>

<div class="team">
  <h1>Go team!</h1>
  <p>“Functioning under the premise that the most kick-ass, edgy and innovative art comes
  when worlds collide, half of the SYNT Team has been on Broadway and the other half is
  under 25. This unique pairing of experienced sophistication and Millennial angst has
  created a production company that pushes the envelope and entertains.”</p>

    <h1>Palin LIVE!</h1>
    <p>Written and Performed by Erica Vlahinos, Directed by Ben Cameron
      Transferring to DC in 2017</p>
    <p>“See Sarah like you’ve never seen her before - voluntarily!
      It’s 2017 and Sarah Palin is back, but this time she’s a MUSICAL! Spend an evening with the
      self anointed “Maverick of Melody” as she dances down the yellow brick road to the White
      House in America’s first ever musical campaign.” </p>

  <div class="shoulda-swallowed">
    <h1>Shoulda Swallowed: Monica Lewinsky and the Women Who F**k Presidents</h1>
    <p>Written and Performed by Erica Vlahinos, Directed by Ben Cameron
      New York run in Spring 2017</p>
    <p>“Why did you sleep with Bill Clinton? How could you do that to another woman? Why didn’t you
      wash the cum off your dress? It’s been 20 years and the gag order is off, leaving Monica
      Lewinsky ready to take on the big questions with a thirst for the truth. Leaving no tooth
      uncovered, Lewinsky spills the story of the fateful night she screwed her courage to the
      sticking place and decided to fill the most powerful position in the land.”</p>
