          <h3>Writer, Producer, Creator, Sarah Palin, Palin LIVE!</h3>
          <p>"Palin LIVE! is an example of smart writing. [It] is a loving spoof that marries politics,
          comedy, and showtunes. Vlahinos puts a Palin twist by adapting the lyrics for laugh-out-loud
          and jaw-dropping moments. [She] used Palin's dialect to her advantage, focusing on words that
          hit the funny. There is a “Best of Palin” element, highlighting some of her wilder moments.
          But she also offers a moment of humanity. …. the journey that Vlahinos takes is strong.
          Palin LIVE! may be a parody but the Sarah Palin on stage was genuine. As a performer, Erica
          Vlahinos did a supreme job creating her own Sarah Palin. Vocally, Vlahinos could likely sing
          the songbook. Her tone is pure with the ability to soar with any of the original tunes. What
          makes her a strong performer is she allowed the comedy to come naturally and subtly. Erica
          Vlahinos has offered an entertaining evening that almost makes you want to be best pals with
          this maverick." <br>
          ....Theater in the Now, Michael Block<br><br>
          "Very talented writing. Very well crafted. Very funny. ... It starts off a jokey, parody then
          dives into who is Sarah Palin as a human being, what makes her tick and how might we find some
          empathy for her. The show elevated itself from being a jokey parody sketch thing to being something
          more meaningful that says some interesting things about who Sarah Palin is and why she is so
          successful at speaking to such a great number of people …. It’s hard to play a character if you
          can’t find the humanity in them and Erica does a really good job of doing just that. … Erica, who
          is a tremendous belter, comes up with Sarah Palin's singing voice which is so spot on and so in
          character that it really works...You should definitely check it out!" <br>
          ....Maxamoo's NYC Theater Podcast, David Levy<br><br>
          "Vlahinos...not only created, produced and wrote the book and lyrics for the new parody musical,
          but she also stars as the polarizing pundit herself. It's South Park-esque zingers paired with a
          young, fresh political perspective have allowed Vlahinos to sling satire over her shoulder like
          the newest Kate Spade. PALiN wears parody like Hillary wears a pantsuit: strong and comfy. Unafraid,
          unrelenting and unflinching PALiN lives a the hunger games style world, where politics and
          entertainment have unapologetically mixed."<br>

          <h3>Percy, The Spitfire Grill</h3>
          <p>"As Percy, Erica Vlahinos demonstrates extraordinary vocal range; her lilting soprano on the opening
           “Ring Around the Moon” segues to a divine, Reba-esque holler on “Out of the Frying Pan,” which segues
           to a soaring Broadway-belt voice on “The Colors of Paradise.” Yet Vlahinos is also a breathtakingly
           understated actor here, allowing you to read the tiniest of Percy’s temperamental shifts through the
           subtlest of inflections and gestures, and it’s a welcome quality."<br>
          ....River Cities' Reader, Mike Schulz<br><br>
          "All eyes, right away, were on the very talented Erica Vlahinos, who plays Percy Talbott, a woman out
          of prison and seeking a new life in a small town called Gilead, Wisconsin. Vlahinos is both as fiery
          and vulnerable as she is gorgeous and strong. Her voice could melt the snow that settles in this town
          during the long winter days and nights. She is talent."<br>

          <h3>Queenie, The Wild Party</h3>
          <p>"As Queenie, Erica Vlahinos struts onto the stage in the very beginning and continues to for the
          next 2 hours. The show is vocally demanding and she seems to be up to the task, slinking and flirting
          her way effortlessly across the stage seducing her guests and the audience simultaneously."<br>
          ....Broadway World, Greg Rice<br><br>
          "Vlahinos nails Queenie's eroticism and manipulative nature.....her performance speaks for itself."<br>
          ....303 Magazine, Noah Jordan<br><br>
          "Erica Vlahinos takes on the role of Queenie in a ferocious and unapologetic performance, Her voice
          is strong, she moves beautifully, and carries this difficult role with a maturity beyond her age."<br>
          ....Denver Theatre Examiner, Deb Flomberg<br><br>
          "Erica Vlahinos...did a wonderful job climbing that mountain of a role and her vocals in "Out of the
          Blue" were flawless....Her voice was strong, always on pitch, and had a unique quality. I've never
          heard anyone sing just like her, which is remarkable to have developed at such a young age. ...she
          nailed the confident innocence that is Queenie's most powerful gift."<br>
